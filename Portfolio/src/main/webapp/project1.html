    <h3>üìÑ Description</h3>
    <p>
      The Vehicle Rental Management System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to automate and streamline the process of renting vehicles online. It enables users to easily book cars, bikes, or buses for a specified time and location, while allowing administrators to manage vehicle listings, user accounts, bookings, homepage content, and user feedback through a secure and user-friendly admin dashboard.

This system provides a convenient interface for both customers and administrators. Users can register, log in, browse available vehicles, book their choice by selecting dates and pickup location, and view the total cost dynamically. Admins can add/edit/delete vehicles and users, view booking details, update payment status, customize the home page, and manage feedback entries.

The application follows a modular design and is developed using:

HTML/CSS for responsive front-end design.

Java Servlets for server-side processing.

MySQL as the backend database to store all the records.

JavaScript for dynamic interactions on the front end.

This project is ideal for real-world deployment by car rental companies or can serve as a solid academic showcase for learning full-stack Java web development.
